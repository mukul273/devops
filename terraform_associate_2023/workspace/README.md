Terraform allows us to have multiple workspaces, with each of the workspace we can have different set of environment variables associated
    1.  ```terraform workspace```
    2.  ```terraform workspace list```
    3.  ```terraform workspace select {workspacename}```
    4.  ```terraform workspace -h```
    5.  ```terraform workspace show```
    6.  ```terraform workspace new dev``` OR ```terraform workspace new {workspacename}```
